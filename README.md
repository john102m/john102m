Software Developer specializing in ASP.NET Core middleware, third-party API integrations, and cloud deployment with Docker and Azure DevOps. Strong experience in unit testing (NUnit, Moq), REST tooling (Swagger, Postman), and full-stack .NET development.
On the side, I engineer embedded audio systems using ESP32, FreeRTOS, and Bluetooth Classic + BLE, with I2S audio capture, ring buffer streaming, and custom BLE volume control via native Android modules. I prototype PCBs in DipTrace, implement power path control with LiPo charging ICs, and debug signal chains from mic to speaker â€” all for the sheer fun of it.
